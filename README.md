## GQLBG - GraphQL Backend generator

![](resources/gqlb.png)

Auto generate database structure, GraphQL resolvers and queries from GraphQL types ðŸš€

## Motivation 

GraphQL can be hard and intimidating initially.
GQLBG helps you to kickstart your experience with any existing GraphQL implementation
by generating backend layer using your predefined types.

## What it does

- Generates required queries and mutations automatically using proven GraphQL patterns
- Generates unopiniated resolvers layer using https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-resolvers
- Generates database DDL statements that can be used to store data (optional)

## Why to use it

- Plain and most canonical GraphQL implementation
Generated resolvers will work with plain GraphQL solutions.

- Works out of the box with Apollo GraphQL framework
Apollo GraphQL is often 

- Full freedom - generated resources can be edited and reconfigured later 

- Custom directives out of the box
Provides set of useful directives and input types that are resolving standard use cases

- Auto generated schema basing on best GraphQL patterns 

- Pick your own server framework and clients (works with Apollo Express and Hapi) 

- Pick your own database
Solution abstract from database storage possibly allows to support any existing storage, by 
implementing available interface

## Getting Started

1) Create GraphQL schema
```graphql
const exampleDefinition = 
    type Note {
        title: String!
        description: String!
    }
```

2) Configure generator

```typescript
const backendGenerator = new GraphQLBackend(exampleDefinition);
```

3) Generate resources

```typescript
backend.createBackend().then((generated: IGraphQLBackend) => {
  console.log(generated)
});
```

See [example](./integration/integration.ts) for more advanced use case

## Supported databases

- Postgress
- MongoDB (WIP)

## Command line client

WIP

## Contribution

This project is intended to be used with v8 (LTS Carbon) release of [Node.js][nodejs] or newer and [NPM][npm]. Make sure you have those installed. Then just type following commands:

```sh
npm install
```

### Available scripts

+ `clean` - remove coverage data, Jest cache and transpiled files,
+ `build` - transpile TypeScript to ES6,
+ `watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically transpile source files,
+ `lint` - lint source files and tests,
+ `test` - run tests,
+ `test:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically re-run tests


## Roadmap

- Support schema first and resolver first approach
Currently supporting only schema first aproach for generation.
We should allow users to define their relationships by defining types.

- Support generation for relationships 
Support relationships generation by providing custom directive processed by
generator.
