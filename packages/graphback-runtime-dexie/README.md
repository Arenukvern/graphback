## Graphback-Runtime-Dexie

Autogenerated runtime layer for your schema.
Graphback runtime can provide out of the box resolver and database layer for your application
without writing any line of the code.

Package provides Dexie datasource for Graphback

## Limitations:

No nested filters
No indexed search - filter implemented in raw ts
No timestamps (`@versioned` is not works, maybe some another too)
ObjectId converts to id and resolves as id as it not possible to have primary key as complex object (see limitations for Dexie or IndexedDb)

> NOTE: This package is an early alpha and not officially supported by Graphback
